=========================================================================

Assumptions:

1. Play thread pools have not been tuned for best performance.
2. There are three files under conf/play-authenticate that have not been commited
   to the GitHub repository due to security concerns. These files are reference in
   the conf/application.conf and are:
     - deadbolt.conf
     - mine.conf
     - smtp.con
2. User uploaded files will contain ASCII/UTF-8 encoded text.
3. The same file is allowed to be processed multiple times (affecting tag ranks).
4. Tags will be generated based on alphabetic content only.
5. The following list of words will be used to filter out "useless" tags (defined in util.ConfigParameter.java):
     "a", "and", "as", "in", "is", "of", "that", "the", "this", "to", "with"
6. Only words greater than one character in length will be used as tags.
